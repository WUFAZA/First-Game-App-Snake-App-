# First-Game-App-Snake-App-

Welcome to Snake App, a simple yet engaging implementation of the classic Snake game. This project was created as a way to test and enhance my skills in object-oriented programming (OOP).

## Features
Object-oriented structure to ensure clean, modular, and reusable code.

Core functionalities for player control, snake movement, and food collection.

Scalable design for future enhancements and new features.

## Purpose
The primary goal of this project was to apply and solidify my understanding of OOP principles such as:

Encapsulation

Inheritance

Polymorphism

Abstraction

## Technologies Used
Language: [Specify programming language used, e.g., Python, Java, C++]

Libraries/Frameworks: [If applicable, mention any libraries or frameworks]

## Code Snippet
(Coming soon! I'll add a concise example once the code is shared.)

## Future Enhancements
Add levels with increasing difficulty.

Implement different snake skins and themes.

Incorporate a leaderboard to track high scores.

Enable multiplayer support.
